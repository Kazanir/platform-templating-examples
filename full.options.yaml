    <p>This template builds Drupal 8 using the [Drupal Composer project](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project) for better flexibility.  It also includes configuration to use Redis for caching, although that must be enabled post-install in `.platform.app.yaml`.</p>
    <p>Drupal is a flexible and extensible PHP-based CMS framework.</p>
